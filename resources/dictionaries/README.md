## File organisations
In this folder, two files per languages (please respect camelcase to make it work on Linux):
- en.txt : English dictionary (uppercase, one word per line)
- en_points.txt : points per letter (one letter per row + space + points)
- en_count.txt : number of letters per letter (one letter per row + space + number of letters)

## Number of words
- English: 178.691
- French:  411.430 (source: ODS8)
